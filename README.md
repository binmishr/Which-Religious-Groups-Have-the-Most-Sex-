# Which-Religious-Groups-Have-the-Most-Sex

There has been plenty of discussion about declining fertility rates and patterns of marriage among people in the United States following the news that the US birth rate declined to its lowest since the Great Depression. There are a lot of debates about why this is the case, whether it be the expense of raising children, the lack of flexible options for women with careers, or a loss of societal values favoring larger families. Part of the backdrop of this demographic change, of course, are changes in how Americans identify themselves, particularly in terms of religion. For the last several decades, Americans have moved away from traditional religious categories like Christianity towards so-called unaffiliated status.

This matters for birth rates because it seems like people who do not have a religious identity are also noticeably less likely to have children. While doing some reading on this subject on my own, which I find fascinating–is there a connection between these changes in religious affiliation and child bearing?–I also wanted to see whether belonging to a religious group changes sexual frequency. In other words, does becoming more or less religious lead to more sexual activity overall? There are a plethora of studies about virtually every side of American sex lives, but surprisingly I couldn’t answer this question from a review of studies (admittedly limited by my knowledge of the field and Google Scholar). As a result, in this post I’ll set out to answer this basic descriptive question:

    Which religious groups have the highest rates of reported sexual activity?

So that you don’t have to read the post, here are the topline findings:

    On the whole, non-religious people have more frequent sex than religious people. However, the differences only exist for unmarried people. For married people, there aren’t very clear differences in terms of sexual frequency, and if anything religious people may have very frequent sex more often.

    When looking at unmarried people, the differences are most pronounced for abstaining from sex entirely (no sexual intercourse in the past year) and more frequent sexual activity (once a week or more). Non-religious unmarried people are much less likely to abstain from sex entirely and considerably more likely to engage in very frequent sexual activity.

    For intermediate levels of sexual activity (once or twice a month), there do not seem to be big differences in sexual frequency by religion no matter how the data is chopped up.
